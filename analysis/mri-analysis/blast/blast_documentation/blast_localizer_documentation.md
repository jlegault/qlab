# Blast localizer documentation

## Overarching aim of subject-specific functional localizer

To identify subject-specific ROIs tuned to language processing and assess relationships between ROI measures, language processing, and various behavioral tasks.

## Advantages of subject-specific functional localizer

This approach provides more sensitivity to language processing, greater specificity for language (over other non-linguistic tasks such as working memory), greater reliability of results due to using shared paradigm.

## Overarching research questions, planned analyses, and hypotheses

### RQ 1: Address whether neural processing of statistical learning tasks is domain specific or domain general
Follow up RQ: Address consistency and sensitivity of GM vs fMRI data 

#### Analyses to run:
1. Take individual beta weights from intact > degraded and run correlations with various behavioral SL tasks.
2. Take individual GMV/CT from intact > degraded ROIs and run correlations with various behavioral SL tasks
3. Control task: Take individual beta weights and GMV/CT from intact > degraded and run correlations with flanker executive function task
4. Control ROI: select an ROI from the multiple demand (MD) network and take individual beta weights and GMV/CT and run correlations with SL tasks
#### Hypotheses:
1. Both GM and fMRI data will show that MRI data correlate with linguistic but not non-linguistic SL
⋅⋅* This would be indicative that 1) neural processing of SL tasks are domain - specific and 2) both GM and fMRI data are consistent and sensitive to SL domain-specific differences
2. Control task: Should have no group differences (or sig cor) between beta weights or GMV and flanker task
3. Control ROI: Should have no group differences (or sig cor) between beta weights or GMV and SL tasks
